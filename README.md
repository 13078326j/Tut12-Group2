# ISDM Project
This is where the decription of the project should go.

1. Outline the objectives of the project and define the problem (Steps 1 & 2 of Design Thinking Methodology).
2. Identify stakeholders.
3. Describe your approach from a Design Thinking principles perspective.
4. Explain the agile methodology, namely, Scrum you have used to carry out the procedure. In
your explanation, ensure that you outline activities from Scrum that you use.
5. List assumptions you have made in the systems analysis.
6. Document your proposed workproducts and models.
7. Discuss the competitive advantages might be gained in developing the new information
system. Identify and discuss the possible adverse effects for this Business if its information
system project fails


Week 1 (Stages 1 and 2 of design thinking)
- Stage 1: Empathy maps
- Stage 2: Define
      =Define the problems that we have identified 
      =Start with the needs of the customer 
          -Know your user
          -Find their needs
          -Develop different points of views 
- Use Empathy Maps and point of view of statements (POV) as a preparation to create the backlog.  
- Identify stakeholders 

Week 2 (Ideation using the above, i.e. using Stages 1 and 2 of the design thinking process. 200-300 word reflections and brainstormed ideas; stating any assumptions made.)
-Create a blacklog. This needs to be prioritized.
-The backlog is created and this needs to be managed using issues in Github i.e., issues are progressively “closed” as the project gets done. The commit that closes each issue should be clearly stated.

Week 3 = Prototyping and models
Iteratively complete:
- Use case diagrams
- Activity diagrams
- Class diagrams
- Collaborative Diagrams

-Issues get removed as their corresponding models are added to the markdown file [use cases are developed from the backlog (1 
to 3 or 4) user stories can be used to create a use case. The use cases are then used to create activity diagrams. These are then used to create class diagrams and collaboration diagrams.

-Commits should identify when this part of the report was added to or modified in the markdown file


Week 4 (E.g. Potential benefits to the call center (in terms of reducing cost and being able to carry out more effective calls). Around 500 words
