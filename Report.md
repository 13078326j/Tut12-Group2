### Stakeholders
* Relationship Managers
* Customers
* Company Owner
* Airline Companies
* Hotel/Resort Companies
* Telecommmunication Provider
* Human Resources
### Assumptions
1. The company owner made the decision to remake and improve the call management centre information system.
2. Relationship managers are incentivised to make sales in order to earn commission
4. Relationship managers with higher skills will get more matches with a customer to offer higher quality services. This might translate into more customers
5. When dealing with a customer, relationship managers must have knowledge about all the holiday packages thats on sale
6. Relationship managers must be persuasive so that they can sell more holiday packages and earn the customer's trust
### Point Of View Statements
1. User: Customers enquiring about holiday packages   
   Need: To engage with Relationship Managers that are knowledgeable in desired package  
   Insight: Current system doesn't target matching between customers and suitable Relationship Managers  
   
2. User: End-Customers looking for best deal on a certain package  
   Need: To engage with Relationship Managers that can find the best possible deal on said package  
   Insight: Current system lacks ability to filter Relationship Managers through skill level and performance  
  
3. User: Relationship Managers who wish to make the most deals for the most commission\
   Need: To connect with customers on a personal level so they can build rapport\
   Insight: Current system does not profile customers and RMs in terms of their age, sex, culture or language proficiency

4. User: Customer wants to talk to a representative of the company as soon as possible and does not want to wait on hold\
   Need: An Interactive Voice Response unit and Automatic Call Distributer to handle their request\
   Insight: Current system poorly handles caller overflow and many customers hang up

5. User: Customer wants to get higher scores so that they are served first\
   Need: Getting a score from 1-10 based on the likelihood to purchase the product according to some pre-loaded criteria\
   Insight:Current system only serves customers with higher scores first and make the lower score customers wait.
   
6. User: Relationship Managers want to help as many customers as possible                   
   Need: To be assigned customers as efficiently as possible                           
   Insight: Current system ineffeciently assigns a customer to a relationship manager

### Reflection
1. All insights made towards the existing (old) system are assumed based on the requests made in the discussion topic
2. Assume that the initial 10 minute profile questionnaire for relationship managers is adequate enough for a strong base 
3. The development of the software is outsource to external company
4. Assume a strong economy, without major recession.
5. Assume that economic policy developments are not unexpected to make our service redundant or undesirable.
6. End-customers will be available for testing during the time they agree to do so.
7. The cost of the project will remain the same as the initial cost.
8. Different departments must provide licence funding as needed.
9. Project will follow agile methodology throughout execution.
10. Training rooms for relationship managers will be available at the training center as needed.
11. The scope of the project will not change as soon as the stakeholders sign the scope statement.
12. Relevant stakeholders will attend weekly meeting for discussions.
13. There is a sub-system that matches with relationship manager and customer
14. Different departments will provide licence funding, as necessary.
15. Internally, training is carried out without any additional costs.
16. The project will follow the principles and criteria of team governance.
17. Project servers arrive configured as expected.
18. The correct number of handheld devices arrives without delays at the target delivery date.


### How Might We Statements
1. How might we ensure customers can engage with relationship managers that are knowledgeable for their desired package?  
2. How might we ensure customers can engage with relationship managers to find the best deals from the holiday package?
3. How might we find a way to connect with customers on a personal level to build a rapport?
4. How might we improve the current system to not let customers hang up when waiting on hold?
5. How might we find a new way to make the system equal without serving customer based on scores?
6. How might we ensure relationship managers avoid only focusing on improving their ranking?
7. How might we improve the current system to assign customers with relationship managers efficiently?
